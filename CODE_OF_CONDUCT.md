# Code of conduct

We expect Dexter's contributors to act professionally and respectfully, and we expect our social spaces to be safe and dignified environments.

Specifically:

* Respect people, their identities, their culture, and their work.
* Be kind. Be courteous. Be welcoming.
* Listen. Consider and acknowledge people's points before responding.

Should you experience anything that makes you feel unwelcome in Dexter's community, please contact [Frostrix](mailto:frostrixz@gmail.com). We will not tolerate harassment from anyone in Dexter's community, even outside of Dexter's public communication channels.

## Questions

It's always ok to ask questions. Once you find the answer, document it in the first place you looked. That way, the next person will be brought up to speed even quicker.
