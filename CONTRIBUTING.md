Developing for Dexter
----------------------

To develop for Dexter, you will eventually need to become familiar with our processes and conventions. This section lists the documents that describe these methodologies. The following list is ordered: it is strongly recommended that you go through these documents in the order presented.

1. [Our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates explicitly that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. This also documents our conflict resolution policy and encourages people to ask questions.

2. [Setting up the development environment](https://github.com/Frostrix/Dexter/wiki/Setting-Up-The-Development-Environment), which describes the steps you need to configure your computer to work with Dexter. Dexter mainly uses C#.

3. [Tree hygiene](https://github.com/Frostrix/Dexter/wiki/Tree-Hygiene), which covers how to land a PR and how to do code review.

4. [Our style guide](https://github.com/Frostrix/Dexter/wiki/Style-Guide), which includes advice for designing for Dexter, and how to format code in the application.

In addition to the above, there are many pages on [our Wiki](https://github.com/Frostrix/Dexter/wiki/). For a curated list of pages see the sidebar
on the wiki's home page. They are more or less listed in order of importance.
