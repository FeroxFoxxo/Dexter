    "{male_name0} wasn't happy with the situation. He had contacted {female_name0} about the mysterious {object_noun0} he had found lying around. She hadn't called him back. The {object_noun0} was surprisingly {object_adjective0}. {male_name0} wasn't sure if that was any clue to what was going on...",

    "{female_name0} could smell gas before she opened the door... She was unsure if this was a clue as to what had been happening. {female_name0} was a prominent {noun0} in her community, and had been called to this scene, though perhaps this had all been a bad joke, or more...",
